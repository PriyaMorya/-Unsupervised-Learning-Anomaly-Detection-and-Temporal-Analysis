        "Question 1 : What is Dimensionality Reduction? Why is it important in machine\n",
        "learning?\n",
        "- Dimensionality reduction is the process of reducing the number of features (variables) in a dataset while retaining its essential information. It is important in machine learning because it combats the \"curse of dimensionality,\" which leads to computational inefficiency, overfitting, and poor model performance. This process simplifies data, leading to faster training, better accuracy, reduced storage needs, and improved data visualization.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Why Dimensionality reduction is important :\n",
        "1. **Combats the curse of dimensionality**: As the number of features grows, data becomes sparse, making it harder for algorithms to find meaningful patterns and increasing the risk of overfitting.\n",
        "2. **Improves model performance**: By removing redundant and irrelevant features, dimensionality reduction helps models focus on the most important information, leading to better accuracy and generalization.\n",
        "3. **Increases computational efficiency**: Reducing the number of features reduces the amount of processing time and storage space required, making it faster and more efficient to train models.\n",
        "4. **Aids data visualization**: It is difficult to visualize data in more than three dimensions, but dimensionality reduction can transform high-dimensional data into a 2D or 3D space, making it easier to visualize and interpret.\n",
        "5. **Reduces multicollinearity**: It can help address multicollinearity, a problem where features are highly correlated with each other, leading to more stable and interpretable models."

        "- Time series analysis can be a powerful method for anomaly detection because it helps identify unusual patterns that deviate from the normal temporal behavior of the data. Since time series data is ordered chronologically, anomalies often appear as values that break expected trends, seasonal patterns, or temporal correlations.\n",
